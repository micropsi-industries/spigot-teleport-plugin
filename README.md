spigot-teleport-plugin
===========

This plugin increases the player's exhaustion by one every time the tppos command is used.
If the exhaustion level exceeds 4 (see minecraft food mechanics), the hunger-llevel is increased, and the exhaustion level reset.
If the player eats, the exhaustion level is reset as well.
